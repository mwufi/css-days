So here's how it's going to go:

1. Create a new HTML file
2. Insert some content from this website: https://learnlayout.com/display.html
3. Realize that you can do this more efficiently with code generation
4. Play around with that idea
5. Realize that the whole point is design!!

Problems:

* `max-width` - The original one had `max-width: 600px` and so I did that... But somehow, the original one has no extra space on mobile (which looks nice), and mine *does* (not as nice)!


Things I learned:

* Why did they make `content` a class? So that you can make the highlighted block a parent in its own right, and the little paragraph in it would follow it around. The only minus is that you have to specify for every element?

Making this more efficient:

* Automatically extract fonts, colors from a webpage
* Variables - learn SASS. or something
* variables for content too. I can totally see why people want to **start** with React or Vue :)

Todo:

* Make it interactive! Add a button to show/remove CSS styles. Make it so that when you hover over certain elements it adds the `elem border` class and highlights it in green! (that'd be *cool*)

1. Buttons from this website: https://www.takeshape.io/

Problems:

* `padding` - I had the wrong fonts, so figuring out why mine looked different was challenging...

Things I learned:

* You have to load specific weights of your fonts!!
* Also, `flexbox` is handy

Taking the HTML from https://sass-lang.com/guide and trying to style it. How do you know what to make of the HTML structure?

I guess the short answer is you *start* from what you want it to look like, and then build it. So we could do that.

Originally planned to make something with canvas and SVG.
