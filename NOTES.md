So here's how it's going to go:

1. Create a new HTML file
2. Insert some content from this website: https://learnlayout.com/display.html
3. Realize that you can do this more efficiently with code generation
4. Play around with that idea
5. Realize that the whole point is design!!

Problems:

* `max-width` - The original one had `max-width: 600px` and so I did that... But somehow, the original one has no extra space on mobile (which looks nice), and mine *does* (not as nice)!


Things I learned:

* Why did they make `content` a class? So that you can make the highlighted block a parent in its own right, and the little paragraph in it would follow it around. The only minus is that you have to specify for every element?

Making this more efficient:

* Automatically extract fonts, colors from a webpage
* Variables - learn SASS. or something
* variables for content too. I can totally see why people want to **start** with React or Vue :)
