# MODD: My 1 Design a Day project!

What's this? It's a thing where I design a new webpage every day! Starting from scratch!

## Why?

I've been waanting to actually learn how to design things, and to feel *confident* (someone insert some fire emojis here w/ a pull request) in building things that I can see! So, here's something that I can do about it!

## I want to follow along!

Every day, I create a new folder.

I want to edit my HTML files and see the changes immediately! To this end, I use `live-server`:

```
npm install -g live-server
```

See `NOTES.md` for more details!
